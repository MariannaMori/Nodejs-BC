# The workflow of testing

1. create API for the module to be tested
2. design test cases based on the API
3. program the tests based on the test cases
4. test (run) the tests (they shoud all fail)
5. implement module to be tested
6. run tests
7. inspect the results in the report
8. if errors fix them and run tests again
